hexo-math
===================

A hexo plugin that uses MathJax to render math equations. Features:

* Automatcially deploy and add reference to MathJax
* Provide support to both MathJax's inline math syntax and math tags

(See a Chinese version of this document [here](http://blog.catx.me/2014/03/09/hexo-mathjax-plugin/))

## Migration Note

### From 1.0.4 (Support Hexo 3.0)

Hexo 3.0 introduces multiple breaking changes. Versions before 1.0.5 won't work with it.
The following changes are made since 1.0.5 to adapt the new 3.0 API:

* Block math tag renamed from `math-block` to `math_block`

### From 1.0.3 and before

Since 1.0.4, MathJax scripts will be injected in `<body>` section instead of `<head>` section.
Before you update `hexo-math` to newer version, you should run:

> $ hexo math uninstall

After `hexo-math` is updated, run install again:

> $ hexo math install

## Install

> npm install hexo-math --save

## Initialize

* Run in your blog project folder:

> $ hexo math install

* Edit `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
- hexo-math
```

## Usage

You can use MathJax's inline math syntax directly. But always remember to escape any special characters by adding a ```\``` before it.
LaTex equations usually contains tones of special characters like ```\```, which makes it painful to escape them one by one. In such cases, you can use hexo-math's tags to make your life easier.

**MathJax Inline:**

```markdown
Simple inline $a = b + c$.
```

**MathJax Block:**

```markdown
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
= h^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}\right)$$
```

**Tag inline:**

```markdown
This equation {% math \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta =  2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 %} is inline.
```

**Tag Block:**
```markdown
{% math_block %}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
{% endmath_block %}
```
